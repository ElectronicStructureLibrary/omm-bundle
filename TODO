Suggestions to upgrade the coding standards
===========================================

The following are only suggestions that will facilitate collaborations and
handing over specific development tasks to third parties. The choice to
implement them or not is purely yours.


Remarks for the 3 libraries
---------------------------

01. A very common practice for optional code is to prefix CPP option names
    with "HAVE_", e.g. "HAVE_MPI".

02. For CPP options, it is better to have self-explanatory names, e.g.:
      - LAP  ---> HAVE_LAPACK;
      - SLAP ---> HAVE_SCALAPACK.
    This makes it much easier for occasional contributors to understand
    the code and greatly reduces the probability of name clashing.

03. ISO C bindings are now supported by 99.99% of the compilers and can be
    enabled all the time, which means that the "CBIND" CPP option is not
    necessary anymore.


Psp
---

01. The name "Psp" is very short and can be confused with
    pseudopotential-related projects. Could be renamed e.g. "PspBLAS".


MatrixSwitch
------------


LibOMM
------

01. There are stand-alone routines in the source tree, which could be integrated into
    Fortran modules.

02. Examples 10, 11 and 12 had lines longer than 120 characters, causing
    portability issues.
