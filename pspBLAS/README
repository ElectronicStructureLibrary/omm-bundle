# PSP

*   The pspBLAS is an extensible distributed-memory parallel library offering a basic set of linear algebra primitives.
*   It achieves scalability and load balance via its 1D or 2D block cyclic distribution.
*   Routines for sparse data types include (sparse) matrix (sparse) vector multiplication, (sparse) matrix (sparse) matrix multiplication, etc.
*   Supports several sparse format, e.g., COO, CSC, and CSR.
*   Similar user habits to ScaLAPACK.
