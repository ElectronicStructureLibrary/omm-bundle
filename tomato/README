tomato
======

Description
-----------

tomato (toy matrices on-the-fly) generates realistic Hamiltonian and overlap
matrices to use as test cases for Kohn-Sham ground-state solvers.

Installation
------------

For the moment, there is only a manual build system which makes use of the files
named Makefile.manual. The manual installation is explained below.

To install the library manually:

1.  Enter the `src` directory.
2.  Copy `make.inc.example` to `make.inc` and modify it to suit your needs.
    Available options for `FPPFLAGS` are:
    * `-DHAVE_MPI`: enable MPI parallel routines
    * `-DNORAND`: fixed seed for the random number generator. Enable for testing
      purposes.
3.  Type `make -f Makefile.manual`.
4.  Type `make -f Makefile.manual install`.
