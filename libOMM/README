libOMM
======

Description
-----------

libOMM solves the Kohn-Sham equation as a generalized eigenvalue problem for a
fixed Hamiltonian. It implements the orbital minimization method (OMM), which
works within a density matrix formalism. The basic strategy of the OMM is to
find the set of Wannier functions (WFs) describing the occupied subspace by
direct unconstrained minimization of an appropriately-constructed functional.
The density matrix can then be calculated from the WFs. The solver is usually
employed within an outer self-consistency (SCF) cycle. Therefore, the WFs
resulting from one SCF iteration can be saved and then re-used as the initial
guess for the next iteration.

Installation
------------

1.  Enter the `src` directory.
2.  Copy `make.inc.example` to `make.inc` and modify it to suit your needs.
    `MSWLIBPATH` should point to the MatrixSwitch directory (default in
    `make.inc.example` is for the version included in the distribution).
    MatrixSwitch should be compiled with the `-DCONV` flag. Available options
    for `FPPFLAGS` are:
    * `-DMPI`: enable MPI parallel routines
    * `-DLAP`: enable LAPACK routines (currently necessary for preconditioning/
      Cholesky factorization)
    * `-DSLAP`: enable ScaLAPACK routines (requires `-DMPI`)
    * `-DNORAND`: fixed seed for the random number generator. Enable for testing
      purposes.
    * `-DCBIND`: use ISO_C_BINDING for LOGICAL inputs in the wrapper interfaces.
      Enable for linking to C.
3.  Type `make`.

Testing
-------

The `examples` directory contains a number of small programs that make use of
libOMM with MatrixSwitch. These can be useful both for testing the installation
and for learning how to use the library. To compile them:

1.   Enter the `examples` directory.
2.   Copy `make.inc.example` to `make.inc` and modify it to suit your needs. Be
     aware that `make.inc` in the `src` directory will also be used.
3.   Type `make`.

Each example contains a header explaining what the program does and providing
sample output to compare against.
